# hexes-of-tenths
A different way of looking at notes. The hex-of-tenths is basically formed of two hexagonals. In each hexagonal, an edge represents a whole step. Crossing among the hexes, represents a half-step.

We represent scales and chords as sequences of half-steps (e.g. [2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1] is major scale).

## TODO
- [ ] Add arrows instead of lines 
- [ ] add relative minors to circle

## Future Work
I would really appreciate if someone could help make this an interactive web application!
